**Delivery Performance Analysis & Optimization**

**Project Overview**

The analysis of delivery performance across several metrics, including timeliness, service channels, customer involvement, team contributions, salespeople, and geographical variances, is the main goal of this project. Finding patterns, inefficiencies, and areas for development is the aim in order to boost customer happiness and logistics effectiveness.

**1.Project Objectives**

The following are the project's main goals:

Sort deliveries into early, on-time, and late categories to assess delivery performance.
Examine monthly patterns to find seasonal differences that impact delivery effectiveness.
Evaluate service channel performance to find out which company categories (such as grocery stores and supermarkets) get delivery on time.
Determine customer delivery patterns, emphasizing clients that deliver the most early and late.
Analyze salespeople's and the team's performance to determine who is performing well and poorly.
Determine which cities have the best and worst delivery performance by analyzing regional variances.
Analyze the typical delivery time for each order to aid in supply chain process optimization.
Offer doable suggestions for enhancing delivery operations, cutting down on delays, and boosting logistics.

**2. Methodology**

In order to produce insights through statistical analysis and visual presentation, this project makes use of past delivery data. The main techniques used are as follows:

Sorting deliveries into early, on-time, and late categories based on scheduled versus actual delivery timings is known as data categorization.
Trend Analysis: Determining regional, seasonal, and monthly delivery patterns.
Performance benchmarking: identifying high performers and opportunities for improvement by comparing various service channels, clients, teams, and salespeople.
Geographic Mapping: Analyzing regional patterns to maximize transportation for various cities.
Practical Insights & Suggestions: Making strategic enhancement suggestions in light of the data findings.

**3. Data Analysis & Key Findings**

**1. Overall Delivery Performance**

Premature Births: 58.64%
Deliveries Made on Time: 19.84%
21.53% of deliveries are late.
Strength: Most deliveries (58.64%) come earlier than expected.
Issue: More than one out of five deliveries (21.53%) arrive late, necessitating process enhancement.

**2. Month-Wise Delivery Performance Trends**

57.21% of events in January were early, 20.03% were on time, and 22.76% were late. 
20.97% of events in February were on time, 22.14% were late, and 56.89% were early. 
Of the events in March, 22.13% were late, 19.52% were on time, and 58.35% were early. 
Of the events in April, 22.18% were on time, 22.06% were late, and 55.76% were early. 
In May, 21.33% of events were on time, 18.55% were late, and 60.12% of events were early. 
20.11% of events in June were on time, 20.41% were late, and 59.48% were early. 
Of the events in July, 20.14% were late, 19.82% were on time, and 60.04% were early. 
Peak Months: The biggest percentage of early deliveries (over 60%) occurs in May and July.
Poorest Month: April has the greatest rate of late deliveries (22.06%), suggesting possible problems with operations.

**3. Service Channel Performance**

(i) Highest Early Deliveries (Best-Performing Service Channels):

Grocery Stores
Supermarkets with 2-4 checkout counters
Confectionery and Bakery
Convenience Stores
(ii) Channels with the Most Late Deliveries:

Large Supermarkets (4+ checkout counters)
Wholesale Distributors
Hypermarkets
Observation: Due to increased order quantities and logistical complexity, larger retail chains have delays in deliveries, but smaller enterprises receive supplies earlier.

**4. Customer Performance Analysis**

(i) Customers Receiving the Most Early Deliveries:

Customer ID 8723, 5542, 2119
(ii) Customers with the Most Late Deliveries:

Customer ID 4499, 8852, 196
Actionable insight: High delivery delays for specific clients point to possible operational or location-based issues that call for focused process enhancements.

**5. Salesperson & Team Performance**

(i) Best Performing Teams (Highest Early Deliveries):

Coast Region Team
North Region Team
South Region Team
(ii) Teams with the Most Late Deliveries:

North Region Team
Valley Region Team
(iii) Top Performing Salespersons:

BCA
BCA-CMD
ITJ
(iv) Salespersons with the Most Late Deliveries:

CAN
TAI
MAF
Observation: While some salespeople constantly do better than others, some have trouble with delivery delays. It can be necessary to track efficiency and provide training.

**6. Regional Delivery Performance**

(i)Cities with the Best Early Deliveries:

Oklahoma City
Baton Rouge
Cincinnati
(ii) Cities with the Most Late Deliveries:

Oklahoma City
Jurupa Valley
Las Vegas
1. Important Takeaway: Oklahoma City shows up in both the top and worst categories, indicating a huge volume of deliveries with some irregularities.
2. Actionable insight: targeted logistical improvement is needed in the Jurupa Valley and Las Vegas.

**7. Average Delivery Days Analysis**

Top salespeople's fastest deliveries often take 1.5 to 2.0 days. 
Underperforming salespeople's slowest deliveries take between 3.2 and 4.5 days. 
Delivery to hypermarkets and retail chains takes 3.8 to 5.0 days on average. 
The fastest deliveries, with an average of 1.2 to 2.5 days, are made to grocery stores and small retailers.
Finding: Because of the increased complexity and coordination needed, delivery to large retail chains takes a lot longer.

**8. Strategic Recommendations**

(i) Areas of Strength:

High early delivery rate (58.64%) → Strong logistics for smaller businesses.
May and July are peak performance months. → Learn from their success.
(ii) Areas for Improvement:

Process optimization is required for deliveries that are 21.53% late.
There are a lot of delays in April; therefore, seasonal modifications are needed.
Las Vegas and the Jurupa Valley exhibit frequent delays.
Some salespeople are performing poorly; they require specialized training.
(iii)Actionable Steps

Plan delivery routes to avoid late delivery hotspots (Las Vegas, Jurupa Valley).
During the months of February through April that have the highest delays, increase personnel and logistical resources.
To cut down on delays, big merchants should coordinate their warehouses better.
Teach ineffective salespeople how to coordinate deliveries and manage their time.

**9.Project Impact**

Important information about delivery patterns, bottlenecks, and performance gaps is provided by this investigation. Businesses can accomplish the following by putting the suggested changes into practice:

Higher delivery efficiency
Reduced late deliveries
Better customer satisfaction
Optimized supply chain operations
